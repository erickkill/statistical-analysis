All three aspect are available at the world bank and third-party source, but they are not 2017.Data at different times would cause issues in our analysis, so I don't use past data.\n",

    "   1. Some indicators are derived from sporadic surveys and are only available every few years.\n",
    "   2. Some indicators and datasets do not include data on high - income countries. This typically occurs because of high - income countries are not World Bank borrowers and thus are not by report figures on topics such as debt and aid.\n",
    "         For example, Poverty data: The scope of poverty series focuses on developing countries (low and middle-income).\n",
    "   3. It is important to note that the UNPD does not produce population estimates for countries with fewer than 50000 inhabitants. So the world bank's databases are incomplete for countries with smaller populations.\n",
    "   4. Complete information had been collected in some countries, and, as a result of poor statistical information systems, may not always report them at the international level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to try address this issue we looked into options of creating a regression analysis and project potential 2017 numbers. However each country lacked vital data to use this process. Our initial approach was to get the data for missing columns for the previous 5 years from 2011 - 2016. The issue I ran into was that many of these countries had 1 or 2 values for a year but none had 5 consecutive years to conduct a viable projection for year 2017. This resulted in us trying to compute the average and use it as a placeholder but the data was too skewed since years prior to 2017 were not consistent enough to get a analysis.\n",

    "Looking at the bar chart I can see that a lot of the Latin American countries have a high adolescent fertility rate. What this measures is how adolescent girls between the ages of 15-19 are giving birth. With this data, and looking at the scatter on the left, I can gather insights that the quality of health service support for these young girls especially in Honduras(outlier) is very poor. This is a cause for concern. Similarly Mexico and Panama also have high Fertility rates, but are below the world average from skilled staff. This can be worrying news, when young girls are giving birth but do not have the quality care they deserve.\n",

    "\n",
    "Access to basic healthcare in Central America largely depends on socioeconomic status and environment (urban or rural). El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have worked to improve access and quality of care, particularly in rural settings. Despite improvements to health services and systems, rural populations still have difficulty accessing basic health services.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see from this correlation, that urban population and life expectancy at birth are highly correlated at around 0.8 on the dark blue scale. This validates the assumptions the CDC provided that health care access is predominantly available to urban populations. An interesting insight is that the Bermuda has a 0% of their population living in rural areas. This is due to the fact the country is only 20.54 mi² and they don’t classify any areas in their country as rural. I can see from the data cells, that from our region Bermuda is 2nd highest in terms of expectancy age. Showing that with their smaller population and access to healthcare services they are living longer. Bermuda’s health spend was 11.5 per cent as a share of its GDP, behind only Switzerland at 12.4 per cent and the US at 17.2 per cent. The OECD average was 9.08 per cent.\n",

When I take a further look, I can see that this was mainly due to the high number of people age < 15. Another observation are Canada and US where both have a high age dependency ratio for population ages 64 and above and low age dependency ratio for ages 15 and below. This can have a negative implication in the economy in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Economical Implications in the long run:\n",
    " 1. As the non-working population increases, those who are working are likely subject to increased taxes to compensate for larger dependent population.\n",
    " 2. As the working population reaches retirement, savings increase, and in turn, decrease long-term interest rates.\n",
    " 3. When there is a growing labor force, housing prices increase.\n",
    " 4. However, if savings decrease, fewer funds are allocated to finance investment projects such as housing, and eventually decreases investment in physical capital.\n",
    " 5. Consumption patterns also change. An increase in the elderly population influences consumption from certain goods towards healthcare services and leisure.\n",
    " 6. Most importantly, if there is an increase in the elderly population, chances are fertility rates will decrease and eventually labor force, thus leading to lower economic growth."

    "\n",
    "Taking a look at the graphs, all have a relatively high employment percentage in the services sector compared to agriculture and industry. One of the outliers we can see is Mexico’s high industrial activities. In the recent years, the government has been making initiatives to reinvigorate its economy by shifting towards more complex commodities such as automobiles and airplanes. Doing so attracts domestic and foreign companies to take root. Among the lowest in agriculture are country giants US and Canada. Both have vast land yet lack to fill the labor needs. For agriculture, on the other hand, Bermuda has no data. The country is prone to severe weather (lies in the hurricane belt), thus industrial and agricultural activities are limited and rely heavily on imports instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where does Latin America’s growth come from?\n",
    " 1. Latin America’s growth is growing faster than Asia\n",
    " 2. Almost 80 percent of Latin America’s GDP growth over the past 15 years has come from strong labor inputs reflecting growing populations rather than rising productivity.\n",
    " 3. Falling fertility rates will undermine employment-led growth. The end of the commodity-price boom that has helped fuel the region’s growth is another concern. \n",
    " 4. In addition, there is a risk of increased protectionism that could weaken the exports component of growth. \n",
    " 5. In the perspective of the US, their growth is a huge opportunity for trade and exports.\n",
